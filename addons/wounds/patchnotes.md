# Concept for now

Burns already exist in ace, but it seems like they don't have to be treated.
I would prefer to change it a bit, that burns have now different degrees and later sizes (size displayed in med menu)
Degree-1-burns would behave like the old burns, degree-2 and -3-wounds would need treatment and imply hypothermia risk. Maybe infections later.
So maybe it would be a good starting point to rename the old burns and add the two new burn "types".
